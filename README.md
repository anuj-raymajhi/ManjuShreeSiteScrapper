well,

install scrapy for your python -> `pip install scrapy`
yeah, its better if you have venv, activate your venv, then install
after you done that, 
`scrapy crawl manjuscraper -o ManjuShreeData.csv -t csv`
in the CLI, within the project directory, you should be able to see the csv popup in there
